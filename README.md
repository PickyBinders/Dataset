# Protein-Ligand Complex Prediction Dataset
This is a reference implementation of protein-ligand dataset curation, annotation and similarity calculation. 
This effort is now continued in PLINDER (https://github.com/aivant/plinder/, to be open-sourced shortly).

## Data Sources
1. Protein Data Bank (PDB) MMCIF files (https://files.wwpdb.org/pub/pdb/data/structures/divided/mmCIF)
See `extract_cif_data.py`. 
2. PDB XML validation reports (https://files.wwpdb.org/pub/pdb/validation_reports/)
See `extract_validation_data.py`.
3. Swiss Model Template Library (e.g https://swissmodel.expasy.org/templates/5KKH)
See `extract_plip_data.py`.
4. PDB Chemical Components Dictionary (https://files.wwpdb.org/pub/pdb/data/monomers/components.cif.gz)
5. PDB seqres (https://files.wwpdb.org/pub/pdb/derived_data/pdb_seqres.txt)
6. AlphaFold Database (https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/)
7. UniRef50 (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniprot/download-center)

## Merging and annotating systems
- All pockets and associated info from the 3 sources are merged into a single dataframe, using the entry_pdb_id, entry_biounit and ligand_chain as the key and annotated (see `create_dataset.py`). Each row of the resulting dataframe is referred to as a ligand system - identified by its (entry_pdb_id, entry_biounit, ligand_chain, ligand_interacting_protein_chains)
- ligand systems are merged into systems if they share the same entry_pdb_id and entry_biounit, and the ligands are within 4A of each other.
- Subsets are created by
    - filtering out systems with only ions
    - filtering out systems with only ions and/or artifacts
- The final dataset consists of all systems with at least one non-ion and non-artifact ligand having <10 protein chains and <10 ligand chains.

## System clustering

A Foldseek search is run on all PDB chains participating in a system (parameters in `run_foldseek.sh`), and the alignments and per-residue lDDT scores are saved. Protein, pocket, pli and ligand-level scores between systems are extracted as in `extract_scores.py`. For each individual score, a graph is created with nodes as systems and edges between systems with a score above a given threshold (see `graph_clustering.py`). Connected components are extracted from these graphs for each system.

## Pairing structures
Systems are paired to cross-docking cases, apo chains and predicted chains as described below. For all three similarity scores between the system and the linked structures are available at the protein and pocket level.

### Cross-docking
For each system, all systems from a different PDB ID which have (`protein_fident_qcov_foldseek_weighted_sum` or `protein_fident_qcov_mmseqs_weighted_sum` > 98%) and (`pocket_fident_foldseek_weighted_sum` or `pocket_fident_mmseqs_weighted_sum` > 98%) are collected as candidates for cross-docking.

### Apo structures
All PDB protein chains not participating in a pocket containing a ligand with >=5 rotatable bonds are considered as apo chains. Each system consisting of a single interacting protien chain is linked where possible to apo chains which have `protein_fident_qcov_mmseqs_weighted_sum` >98%. 

### Predicted structures
An Mmseqs search is run for all system chains against all UniRef50 members with an AFDB structure of the UniProt IDs associated with each holo chain with `--min-seq-id 0.98 -c 0.9`. Each system consisting of a single interacting protein chain is linked where possible to predicted structures which have `protein_fident_qcov_mmseqs_weighted_sum` >98%.
